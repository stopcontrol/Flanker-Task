A Eriksen Flanker task that runs within a browser.

In cognitive psychology, the Eriksen Flanker Task is a set of response inhibition tests used to assess the ability to suppress responses that are inappropriate in a particular context. The target is flanked by non-target stimuli which correspond either to the same directional response as the target (congruent flankers), to the opposite response (incongruent flankers), or to neither (neutral flankers).
